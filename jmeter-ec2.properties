# EC2-VPC Usage
# 
# jmeter-ec2 can configure EC2-VPC instances. You must:
#   - set SUBNET_ID to the id of the subnet that the instance will belong to
#   - make sure that the AMI is compatible with EC2-VPC
#   - enable DNS Resolution in the VPC
#   - enable DNS hostnames in the VPC
# 
SUBNET_ID=""                 # The subnet that the instance will belong to.

# Remote hosts
#
# If this is set then the script will ignore INSTANCE_COUNT passed in at the command line and read in this list of hostnames to run the test over
# instead. If it is not set then n number of hosts will be requested from Amazon.
#
# Must be a comma-separated list, like this:
# REMOTE_HOSTS="ec2-46-51-135-180.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com,ec2-176-34-204-10.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com"
# or:
# REMOTE_HOSTS="myhost.com,antherhost.com"
# or:
# REMOTE_HOSTS="blahblah.corp.synergy:2020,10.213.45.6"
